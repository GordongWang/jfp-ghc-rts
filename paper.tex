\section{Introduction}

The GHC runtime system is perhaps one of the most unusual language
runtimes in wide use today.  Much of its implementation was directly
motivated by the unusual (by popular programming language standards!)
features in Haskell which the runtime needs to support.  Some of these
features, e.g. lazy evaluation and ubiquitous concurrency, complicate
the design of the system and require us to do a lot more work to give
programmers the high-level behavior they desire.  Other features, such
as an emphasis on pure computation without mutation, simplify the design
components such as garbage collection and software transactional memory.
